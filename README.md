# MyReads Project

The project is a book library showing the books that I'm currently reading , the books that I want to read and the books that I read
You can shuffle the book shelf by using the drop down menu on each book

You can also search for new books to add to the collections using the search link

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
